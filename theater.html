    <h1>Anthony Jack does Checkov tonight</h1>
    <h2>The wedding, by: Anton Checkov</h2>
    YATS. I never... I... I don't understand.... Please, I'll go.... Only
    you first give me the five roubles which you borrowed from me last year
    on the strength of a _piqu√©_ waistcoat, if I may say so. Then I'll just
    have another drink and... go, only give me the money first.

    VARIOUS GENTLEMEN. Sit down! That's enough! Is it worth it, just for
    such trifles?

    A GROOMSMAN. [Shouts] The health of the bride's parents, Evdokim
    Zaharitch and Nastasya Timofeyevna! [Band plays a flourish. Cheers.]

    ZHIGALOV. [Bows in all directions, in great emotion] I thank you! Dear
    guests! I am very grateful to you for not having forgotten and for
    having conferred this honour upon us without being standoffish And you
    must not think that I'm a rascal, or that I'm trying to swindle anybody.
    I'm speaking from my heart--from the purity of my soul! I wouldn't deny
    anything to good people! We thank you very humbly! [Kisses.]

    DASHENKA. [To her mother] Mama, why are you crying? I'm so happy!

    APLOMBOV. _Maman_ is disturbed at your coming separation. But I should
    advise her rather to remember the last talk we had.

    YATS. Don't cry, Nastasya Timofeyevna! Just think what are human tears,
    anyway? Just petty psychiatry, and nothing more!

    ZMEYUKINA. And are there any red-haired men in Greece?
