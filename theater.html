    <h1>Anthony Jack does Checkov tonight</h1>
    <h2>The wedding, by: Anton Checkov</h2>
    <h3>YATS.</h3> <p>I never... I... I don't understand.... Please, I'll go.... Only
    you first give me the five roubles which you borrowed from me last year
    on the strength of a _piqu√©_ waistcoat, if I may say so. Then I'll just
    have another drink and... go, only give me the money first.</p>

    <h3>GENTLEMEN.</h3> <p>Sit down! That's enough! Is it worth it, just for
    such trifles?</p>

    <h3>A GROOMSMAN.</h3> <p>[Shouts]</p><p> The health of the bride's parents, Evdokim
    Zaharitch and Nastasya Timofeyevna!</p><p>[Band plays a flourish. Cheers.]</p>

    <h3> ZHIGALOV. </h3> <p>[Bows in all directions, in great emotion]</p> <p> I thank you! Dear
    guests! I am very grateful to you for not having forgotten and for
    having conferred this honour upon us without being standoffish And you
    must not think that I'm a rascal, or that I'm trying to swindle anybody.
    I'm speaking from my heart--from the purity of my soul! I wouldn't deny
    anything to good people! We thank you very humbly! </p><p>[Kisses.]</p>

    <h3>DASHENKA.</h3> <p>[To her mother]</p> <p>Mama, why are you crying? I'm so happy!</p>

    <h3>APLOMBOV.</h3> <p>_Maman_ is disturbed at your coming separation. But I should
    advise her rather to remember the last talk we had.</p>

    <h3>YATS.</h3><p> Don't cry, Nastasya Timofeyevna! Just think what are human tears,
    anyway? Just petty psychiatry, and nothing more!</p>

    <h3>ZMEYUKINA.</h3> <p>And are there any red-haired men in Greece?</p>
